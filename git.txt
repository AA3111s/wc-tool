forking: Copy a repository into your own account

default storing is in a hidden folder called .ssh/id_rsa

~ : is an alias for our own directory 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub : outputs the SSH key

to check: ssh -T git@github.com

public key denied error --> agent running 

eval 'ssh-agent -s'
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa : adds key

new branch: git checkout -b feature/login : creates and switches to new branch 
git push -u origin feature/login
git merge feature/login
git branch -d : deletes a branch


Deploying a simple CI/CD pipeline with continous integration and continuous deployment with vercel
